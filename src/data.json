Robed men sell ornate carpets and a camel nibbles affectionately at your ear.  OK, we\u2019re pretty sure Paul McKenna\u2019s job is safe for now, but get cooking this recipe and take dinnertime on a magic carpet ride to Casablanca! Our tip for this recipe is to take your meat out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before dinner which will allow you to cook it more evenly.",

For our intern Simon, it was this lip-smackingly awesome Sea Bream. Taking the warm crunchiness of potatoes against the fresh southern asian flavours of fish with coriander, ginger and lime, it\u2019s the perfect dish for transporting your tastebuds. Don\u2019t let the smell of the fish sauce throw you - add it gradually to your sauce for a really authentic asian spin!",

We\u2019re pretty sure that was the inspiration behind this little number. Tonight, prepare to create a little nostalgia that the little \u2018uns will remember for years!",

That said, every dinner is a chance to practice your presentation skills. Bigger plates are a great way of framing your food and a sprinkle of herbs or a drizzle of olive oil at the end gives everything a bit more pizzazz. For this recipe, we took classic Mexican ingredients and played with the presentation to create something that\u2019s as tasty to the eye as it is to the tongue. Arriba!",

With the onset of Winter Patrick has taken some decidedly seasonal squash and the deep, heady scent of rosemary and combined them with the lighter flavour of feta and wild rice. The squash takes a little bit of work with a vegetable peeler but once you\u2019ve tackled and roasted it you\u2019ll never look back. We use any leftovers for butternut squash soup!",
